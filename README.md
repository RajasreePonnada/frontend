Reputome is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to evaluate and manage reputation scores using True Networkâ€™s attestation services. The platform adapts dynamically to evolving datasets, simulates interconnected and inheritable reputation, and ensures that data integrity and transparency are upheld through blockchain-based computations.

#### Features:
###### Core Features:
1. Dynamic Reputation Scoring: Reputome calculates real-time reputation scores based on diverse, weighted datasets.
2. True Network Attestations: Ensures all data and computations are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof.
3. Entropy-Driven Evaluation: Weighs data based on unpredictability and relevance to create fair and adaptive scores.
4. Scalable Input Processing: Supports CSV-based data inputs for seamless integration with large datasets.

##### Supported Use Cases:

1. GitHub Reputation Scoring:
Evaluates contribution patterns, repositories, and commit gaps.
Useful for protocol grants, hackathon acceptances, and project evaluations.
2. Supply Chain Transparency:
Tracks actions and events on the supply chain, ensuring immutable and verifiable reputation scoring.
3. DeFi and DAO Applications:
Builds trust in decentralized voting and credit scoring systems.
How It Works
1. Input Data
Accepts user identifiers (e.g., wallet addresses, GitHub profiles) or CSV files.
Data is validated through True Network attestations.
2. Reputation Calculation
An attested algorithm on True Network evaluates the data to calculate scores.
Older or irrelevant data loses weight, while high-entropy (unpredictable) data contributes more to the score.
